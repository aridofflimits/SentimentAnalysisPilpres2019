# Introduction

This GitHub repository presents a sentiment analysis project focused on analyzing tweets related to the 2019 Presidential Election in Indonesia. The core objective of this project is to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, thereby offering an objective analysis of public opinion during the election period. Utilizing a dataset of 1,814 labeled tweets, the project employs two distinct analytical approaches: Random Forest and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, each chosen for their effectiveness in processing and categorizing textual data.

The dataset, specifically collected during the 2019 election, is annotated with sentiments, providing a structured foundation for training the models. This project aims to deliver insights into the sentiment distribution among the tweets, contributing to a better understanding of public sentiment during significant political events. Through this repository, I offer a comprehensive toolkit for sentiment analysis, designed to be both robust and sensitive to the nuances of social media discourse.
